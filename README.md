 My AoC Solutions

Hello!

All solutions are written in c++, and make liberal use of modern c++20 language and library features - I use these problems as a test bed for modern standards.

Solutions are designed to take input from file redirection, for example, to run 2021a:

```
aoc2021_01a < aoc2021_01a_test.txt
```

The test inputs are provided in `\*_test.txt` files.
